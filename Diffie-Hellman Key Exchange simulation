## Introduction:
	  This program purposes on simulating Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm with Fast Exponentiation Modulus and Miller-Rabin Primality Test. The language applied in this program is JAVA.

## Methods:
	  This program can be clearly divided into three parts: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, Fast Exponentiation Modulus and Miller-Rabin Primality Test. I will explain these three implementations one by one:
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
